      "posting_reason": "The entry 'MuST2-Learn: Multi-view Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning for Heterogeneous Municipal Service Time Estimation' was selected due to its explicit mention of 'Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning' in the title and summary, directly aligning with the 'Spatio Temporal' keyword. Its high usefulness score of 95 also indicates its quality. The methodology described is a 'multi-view spatial-temporal-type learning approach,' which is highly relevant to the user's interest in spatio-temporal modeling."

      "posting_reason": "Selected 'Fast approximate Bayesian inference of HIV indicators using PCA adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature' because it directly addresses 'spatial evidence synthesis model' for 'HIV epidemic indicators', aligning with 'Spatio Temporal' analysis. It also explicitly uses 'household survey data' and 'health system data', which are forms of 'Survey data' and 'Contextual dataset' respectively."
