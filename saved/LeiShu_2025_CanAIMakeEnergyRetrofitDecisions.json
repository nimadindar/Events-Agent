  "summary": "This paper evaluates LLMs for residential energy retrofit decisions, processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable recommendations.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06307v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions processing 'contextual information' for decision-making, which is directly relevant to 'Contextual dataset'. While 'Spatio Temporal Point Process' is not directly mentioned, the application of LLMs to complex decision-making based on contextual data could involve underlying spatio-temporal aspects."
