  "summary": "This paper proposes CausalPre, a scalable and effective data pre-processing solution for causal fairness in databases. It addresses limitations of prior work by capturing broader attribute relationships critical to maintaining utility, without relying on a known causal model.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on \"data pre-processing\" for \"causal fairness\" in \"databases\". While not explicitly \"contextual dataset\" or \"survey data\", the concept of \"causal fairness\" and \"attribute relationships\" implies dealing with contextual information within a dataset. This makes it tangentially relevant to \"Contextual dataset\"."
