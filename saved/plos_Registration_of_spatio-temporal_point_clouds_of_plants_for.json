  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 80 assigned because the title and summary explicitly mention 'spatio-temporal point clouds' and '3D sensor data,' which are highly relevant to the query, particularly 'Spatio Temporal' and 'Point Process' (as point clouds are a form of point data)."
