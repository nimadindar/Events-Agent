  "summary": "This paper presents a mathematical model to investigate how social interaction can impact vaccine hesitancy. The model describes the temporal transitions between different vaccination classes of the population, analyzing the impact of political trends and the interaction across age and education groups in the USA.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on a \"mathematical model\" that describes \"temporal transitions\" in vaccine hesitancy, which aligns with the 'Temporal' aspect of the query. It also implicitly deals with 'Survey data' as it analyzes social interactions and demographic groups, which are often derived from survey-like information."
