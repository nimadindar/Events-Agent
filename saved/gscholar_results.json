      "abstract": "This paper discusses critical issues that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic's reliance on data and analysis, including media distortions and the framing of risk and uncertainty. It emphasizes the need for critical appraisal of assumptions underpinning scientific evidence to strengthen preparedness for future public health threats. The authors question the flexibility of the deconvolution framework in addressing the precise timing of infection peaks.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces easyZloc, a 3D single molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) approach utilizing a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network. It is generally applicable, including with standard fluorescence microscopes, and aims to be practically useful in high-throughput SMLM workflows. The method demonstrates reconstruction of nuclear pore complexes with comparable performance to existing methods but with reduced computational power and execution time.",
