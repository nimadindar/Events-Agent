      "summary": "This paper proposes a new inference method for a spatial evidence synthesis model (Naomi) used to produce district-level HIV epidemic indicators. The model utilizes both household survey data and routinely reported health system data. The new method, based on an extension of adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature, improves the accuracy and speed of inference for model parameters.",
