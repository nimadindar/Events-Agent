  "summary": "This paper investigates constraints on the InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF) using time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It simulates data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to derive these constraints.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract mentions \"time-delayed\" and \"along their path to the Earth\" which implies spatio-temporal aspects. The simulation of data can be considered a form of contextual dataset, and the use of an \"Observatory\" suggests a survey-like data collection."
