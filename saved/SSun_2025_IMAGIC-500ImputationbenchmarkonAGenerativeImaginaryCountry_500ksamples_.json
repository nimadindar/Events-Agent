  "summary": "This paper introduces IMAGIC-500, a synthetic dataset derived from a World Bank household survey, to benchmark missing data imputation methods in socioeconomic research. It evaluates imputation accuracy and impact on downstream predictive tasks under various missing mechanisms and ratios.",
  "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08844",
  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 80 assigned because the paper focuses on missing data imputation in \"socioeconomic datasets\" and utilizes a \"World Bank household survey,\" directly addressing \"Contextual dataset\" and \"Survey data\" keywords. It does not, however, focus on spatio-temporal point processes."
