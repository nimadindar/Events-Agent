  "summary": "This paper proposes STFT-AECNN, an attention-enhanced CNN for efficient event recognition from Φ-OTDR data streams in IoT infrastructures. It addresses the challenge of accurately recognizing events from massive Φ-OTDR data while preserving their inherent spatiotemporal structure, enabling large-scale distributed acoustic sensing for various applications.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on \"event recognition\" from \"Φ-OTDR data streams\" and emphasizes preserving \"inherent spatiotemporal structure\". This directly relates to \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Point Process\" (events). While not explicitly a \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\" model, the core problem involves spatio-temporal event detection."
