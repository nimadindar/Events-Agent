  "summary": "This paper introduces SpatialVID, a large-scale video dataset with spatial annotations, addressing the limitations of existing datasets in terms of scale, diversity, and annotation richness for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion. It aims to advance spatial intelligence and world exploration.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09676v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper discusses \"spatial intelligence\" and \"spatial annotations\" in the context of a \"large-scale video dataset,\" which aligns with \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Contextual dataset.\" While \"point process\" is not explicitly mentioned, the focus on spatial and temporal data for analysis makes it relevant."
