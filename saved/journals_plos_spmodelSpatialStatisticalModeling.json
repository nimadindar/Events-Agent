  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 80 assigned because the title mentions \"Spatial statistical modeling\" and \"point-referenced...data\", which is directly relevant to \"Point Process\" and \"Spatio Temporal\" concepts. The content also discusses modeling and prediction, which aligns with analyzing contextual datasets."
