  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions a \"pulsar survey\" and the detection of pulsars, which can be considered a form of \"Point Process\" in an astronomical context (events occurring at specific points). It also uses \"survey data\". However, it does not explicitly use the term \"Point Process\" in a statistical modeling sense, nor \"Contextual dataset\"."
