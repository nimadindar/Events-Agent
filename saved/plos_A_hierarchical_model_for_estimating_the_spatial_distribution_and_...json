  "publish_date": "unknown",
  "summary": "This article describes a hierarchical model that includes a spatial point process for individual activity centers and a temporal point process for detection times. It extends count-based SCR models to account for temporal heterogeneity in detection rates.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article is highly relevant as it explicitly discusses a 'spatial point process' and a 'temporal point process', which directly addresses 'Spatio Temporal Point Process'. It also mentions 'detection times' and 'detection rates', which can be considered contextual data related to observations."
