  "summary": "This paper focuses on real-time small area estimation of food security by integrating mobile-phone and face-to-face survey data in Zimbabwe. It highlights the use of scalable and temporally rich data sources for monitoring food security.",

  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper directly addresses \"real-time small area estimation\" and integrates \"mobile-phone and face-to-face surveys\", making it highly relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\" (real-time and small area) and \"Survey data\". The context of food security also implies a \"Contextual dataset\"."
