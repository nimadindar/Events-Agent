  "summary": "This paper presents a new dataset and analysis for audio-based pedestrian detection in the presence of vehicular noise. It explores cross-dataset evaluation and the impact of noisy data on model performance, highlighting the influence of acoustic context.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19295v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions a \"new dataset\" and discusses the \"presence of vehicular noise\" and \"acoustic context\", which aligns with the concept of a \"Contextual dataset\". While not directly about spatio-temporal point processes, the focus on a specific type of contextual data makes it relevant."
