  "summary": "This paper introduces ContextFusion and Bootstrap to improve slot attention-based object-centric learning by addressing the lack of high-level semantic information and leveraging relationships to understand the environment.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02032v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the title 'ContextFusion' and the summary's mention of 'relationships to understand the environment' and 'high-level semantic information' suggest a focus on contextual understanding, making it relevant to 'Contextual dataset'."
