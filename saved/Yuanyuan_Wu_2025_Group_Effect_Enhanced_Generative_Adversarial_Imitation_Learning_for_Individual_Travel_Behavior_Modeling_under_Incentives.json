  "summary": "This paper focuses on understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses, addressing challenges of data quantity and spatial-temporal coverage in dynamic travel behavior modeling using a Markov decision process framework.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06656v1",
  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "The summary explicitly mentions \"spatial-temporal coverage\" in the context of \"individual travel behavior modeling,\" which is highly relevant to spatio-temporal data. Travel behavior can often be modeled as point processes in space and time."
