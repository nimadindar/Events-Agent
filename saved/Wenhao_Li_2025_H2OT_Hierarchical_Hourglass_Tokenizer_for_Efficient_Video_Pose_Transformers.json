  "summary": "This paper presents a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos, addressing the high computational costs of video pose transformers (VPTs).",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title and summary mention 'video-based 3D human pose estimation' and 'video pose transformers', which implies spatio-temporal data processing. While not directly about point processes, it deals with spatio-temporal information."
