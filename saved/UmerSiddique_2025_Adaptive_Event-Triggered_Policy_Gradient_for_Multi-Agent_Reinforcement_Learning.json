  "summary": "This paper proposes ET-MAPG, an event-triggered multi-agent policy gradient reinforcement learning framework. It jointly learns an agent's control policy and its event-triggering policy to address the computational and communication intensity of conventional time-triggered MARL methods.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on \"event-triggered\" execution, which is a strong indicator of a point process. While not explicitly spatio-temporal, the multi-agent context often implies spatial distribution, and the events occur over time. This aligns well with the 'Point Process' aspect of the query."
