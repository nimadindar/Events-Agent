  "summary": "This paper introduces a new benchmarking dataset based on the MGPHot dataset, including expert musicological annotations for music autotagging, to evaluate general-purpose music representations.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06936v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper introduces a \"benchmarking dataset\" with \"expert musicological annotations,\" which directly relates to the concept of a 'Contextual dataset' for a specific application."
