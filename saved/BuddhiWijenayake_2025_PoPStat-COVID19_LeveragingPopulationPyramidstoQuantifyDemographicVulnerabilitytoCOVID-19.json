  "summary": "This paper extends the PoPStat framework to quantify demographic vulnerability to COVID-19 by leveraging population age structure. It uses 2019 United Nations World Population Prospects age-sex distributions to link population pyramids with cause-specific mortality, providing a more comprehensive understanding of pandemic preparedness.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14213v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper utilizes \"2019 United Nations World Population Prospects age-sex distributions\", which are a form of demographic data typically collected through surveys or censuses. This directly relates to the 'Survey data' aspect of the query, as it involves the analysis of large-scale population data."
