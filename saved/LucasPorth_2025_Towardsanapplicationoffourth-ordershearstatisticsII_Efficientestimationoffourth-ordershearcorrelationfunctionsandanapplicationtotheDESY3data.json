  "summary": "This paper focuses on the efficient estimation of fourth-order shear correlation functions and applies this method to data from Stage-III lensing surveys, specifically the DES Y3 data, to extract cosmological information.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07974v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "This paper explicitly mentions 'Stage-III lensing surveys' and 'application to the DES Y3 data', directly indicating the use and analysis of survey data in a cosmological context. While the focus is on lensing statistics, the direct reference to 'surveys' and 'data' makes it relevant to 'Survey data'."
