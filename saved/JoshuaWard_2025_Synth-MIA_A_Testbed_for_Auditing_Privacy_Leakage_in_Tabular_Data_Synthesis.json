  "summary": "This paper introduces Synth-MIA, a testbed for auditing privacy leakage in tabular data synthesis, addressing challenges in evaluating empirical privacy of tabular generative models and the limitations of existing Membership Inference Attacks.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18014v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper deals with \"synthetic datasets\" and \"tabular data synthesis\", which are forms of \"contextual datasets\". It's not directly about spatio-temporal point processes or survey data, but the creation and analysis of contextual data is relevant."
