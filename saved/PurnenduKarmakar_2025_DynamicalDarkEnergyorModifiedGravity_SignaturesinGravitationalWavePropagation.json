  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions using \"DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) DR2 and DESyr5 compilation of supernovae (SNe) datasets,\" which are large-scale astronomical survey datasets. This directly relates to the 'Survey data' aspect of the query."
