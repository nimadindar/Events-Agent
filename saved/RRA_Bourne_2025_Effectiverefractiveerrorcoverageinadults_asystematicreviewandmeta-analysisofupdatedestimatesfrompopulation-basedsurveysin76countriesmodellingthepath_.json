  "summary": "This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzes data from 237 population-based eye surveys across 76 countries to model global and regional estimates of effective refractive error coverage (eREC) in adults. The study evaluates progress towards the WHO global target for eREC by 2030.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions and is based on \"population-based surveys\", which is directly relevant to the 'Survey data' keyword. While not focused on spatio-temporal point processes, its strong reliance on survey data makes it clearly relevant to one of the key search terms."
