  "summary": "This paper investigates the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in observed magnitudes of background galaxies using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15490v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper explicitly uses data from the \"Kilo-Degree Survey\", which is a type of \"Survey data\". The investigation of dust distribution in galactic halos also implies a spatial aspect, making it relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\"."
