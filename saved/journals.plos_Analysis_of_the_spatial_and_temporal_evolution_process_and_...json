  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the title and summary clearly focus on 'spatial and temporal evolution process' and use 'Spatial-temporal correlation analysis', which is highly relevant to spatio-temporal analysis. While not directly mentioning point processes or contextual datasets, the core spatio-temporal aspect is strong."
