  "summary": "This paper describes a hierarchical model that includes a spatial point process for individual activity centers and a temporal point process for detection times. It extends count-based SCR models and is illustrated by analyzing tiger detection times in a spatial array.",

  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article is highly relevant as it directly discusses 'spatial point process' and 'temporal point process', which are core to the query. The data collection method, involving detection times in a spatial array, is akin to survey data."
