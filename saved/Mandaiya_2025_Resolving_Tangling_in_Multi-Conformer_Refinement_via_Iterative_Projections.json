  "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of extracting cooperative motions from temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps in structural biology. It proposes a method to resolve the tangling phenomenon in multi-conformer refinement, which is crucial for handling conformational heterogeneity.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05189v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions 'temporally and spatially averaged electron density maps' and 'protein dynamics', which directly relates to spatio-temporal aspects. While it doesn't mention point processes or survey data, the focus on dynamic structural data makes it relevant to spatio-temporal analysis."
