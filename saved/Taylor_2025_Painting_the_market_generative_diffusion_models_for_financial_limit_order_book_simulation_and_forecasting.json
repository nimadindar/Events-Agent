  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel approach for simulating and forecasting financial limit order books (LOBs) by converting LOB data into a structured image format and applying diffusion models with inpainting. This addresses the challenges of high noise and complexity in financial market data.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05107v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on simulating and forecasting financial limit order books, which are inherently spatio-temporal in nature (price levels over time). The use of \"generative diffusion models\" and \"structured image format\" for LOB data implies a spatio-temporal representation and analysis."
