  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title and abstract explicitly mention \"Building High-Quality Datasets\" and \"training data\", which is directly relevant to the \"Contextual dataset\" aspect of the query. While it doesn't mention spatio-temporal or point processes, the strong focus on dataset creation makes it useful."
