      "summary": "Hawkes processes were first introduced to obtain microscopic models for the rough volatility observed in asset prices. Scaling limits of such processes leads to the rough-Heston model that describes the macroscopic behavior. Blanc et al. (2017) show that Time-reversal asymmetry (TRA) or the Zumbach effect can be modeled using Quadratic Hawkes (QHawkes) processes. Dandapani et al. (2021) obtain a super-rough-Heston model as scaling limit of QHawkes processes in the case where the impact of buying",

      "summary": "A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions. Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an",

In this work, we investigate the effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dy",
