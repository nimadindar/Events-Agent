By integrating quantitative survey data with qualitative interview insights, we examine how cultural, social, and contextual factors influence users' understanding of fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems. Our findings reveal nuanced attitudes toward human oversight, explanation mechanisms, and contestability, highlighting the importance of context in designing fair AI.",

      "abstract": "More than a billion people around the world experience intermittence in their water supply, posing challenges for urban households in Global South cities. An intermittent water supply (IWS) system prompts water users to adapt to service deficits which entails coping costs. Adaptation and its impacts can vary between households within the same city, leading to intra-urban inequality. Studies on household adaptation to IWS through survey data are limited to exploring income-based heterogeneity and this paper addresses this gap by clustering household types in Amman, Jordan.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite imagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level wealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can be leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training objectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently suffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of causal treatment effects and limiting their use in causal inference. This paper proposes a method for debiasing these predictions without additional ground truth data.",
