    "abstract": "Models for fitting spatio-temporal point processes should incorporate spatio-temporal inhomogeneity and allow for different types of interaction between points (clustering or regularity). This paper proposes an extension of the spatial multi-scale area-interaction model to a spatio-temporal framework. This model allows for interaction between points at different spatio-temporal scales and the inclusion of covariates. We fit the proposed model to varicella cases registered during 2013 in Valencia, Spain. The fitted model indicates small scale clustering and regularity for higher spatio-temporal scales.",

    "abstract": "This work presents PointLCA-Net, which leverages the strengths of PointNets for extracting robust features from input point sets, while utilizing the efficiency of Exemplar LCA to encode these features. PointLCA-Net achieves a high accuracy of 93.41% on DVS128 while reducing energy consumption by approximately 92% compared to other spiking neural networks applied to point clouds, making the system more efficient and well-suited for energy-constrained applications.",
