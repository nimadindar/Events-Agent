      "abstract": "This paper introduces STACI, a framework that combines a Bayesian neural network approximation of a non-stationary spatio-temporal Gaussian Process with a conformal inference algorithm. It aims to provide scalable and statistically valid prediction intervals for spatio-temporal data, addressing the limitations of traditional Gaussian Processes in terms of scalability and restrictive assumptions.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes PointLCA-Net, a novel method combining PointNets with Exemplar LCA for energy-efficient spatio-temporal signal recognition on neuromorphic hardware. It converts spatio-temporal data into point clouds and uses a pre-trained PointNet for feature extraction, followed by an Exemplar LCA-Decoder for encoding and classification. The method is evaluated on NMNIST, DVS128, and SHD datasets, showing high accuracy and significant energy savings.",

It presents three datasets modeling epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunamis. The paper also benchmarks several ML models on the epidemiological dataset and shows that pre-training on this synthetic data improves performance on real-world data.",

      "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, data and analysis took centre stage in shaping public discourse and informing policy decisions. This heightened reliance on modelling placed considerable demands on the scientific community. The paper by Wood et al. highlights several critical issues that emerged from this time, including media distortions, the framing of risk and uncertainty, and the need for a critical appraisal of the assumptions underpinning scientific evidence. We strongly agree that reflecting on these challenges is essential for strengthening preparedness for future public health threats. However, we contend that the paper by Wood et al. overlooks several important considerations and introduces assumptions of its own. In particular, we question whether the deconvolution framework, while parsimonious, is sufficiently flexible to address all questions regarding the precise timing of infection peaks-and by \u2026",
