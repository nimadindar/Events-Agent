      "abstract": "Spatiotemporal point processes (STPPs) are probabilistic models for events that occur in continuous space and time. Real-world event data often exhibit complex dependencies and heterogeneous dynamics. By incorporating modern deep learning techniques, STPPs can model these complexities more effectively than traditional approaches. As a result, the fusion of neural methods with STPPs has become an active and rapidly evolving area of research. In this review, we categorize existing approaches, unify the field, and identify key trends and challenges.",
