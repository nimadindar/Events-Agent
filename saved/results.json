      "abstract": "This paper introduces a multi-scale area-interaction model for spatio-temporal point processes, extending the spatial model to a spatio-temporal framework. The model allows for interactions at different scales and the inclusion of covariates. It is applied to varicella cases in Valencia, Spain, revealing small-scale clustering and regularity at larger spatio-temporal scales.",

It introduces partial point characteristics and extends the spatial dependence graph model formalism. The proposed graphical model, based on partial spectral density characteristics, is computationally efficient and reflects conditional similarity among spatio-temporal sub-processes.",
