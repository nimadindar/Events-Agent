      "abstract": "This work reviews Bayesian nonparametric clustering methods for spatio-temporal data, focusing on their application to air pollution. It introduces modeling approaches for point-referenced spatio-temporal data and discusses recent advancements in Bayesian clustering, particularly spatial product partition models. The methods are illustrated on PM10 monitoring data from Northern Italy.",

      "abstract": "This work presents PointLCA-Net, a novel energy-efficient architecture for recognizing sparse spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. The method treats these signals as 3D point clouds and uses a pre-trained PointNet to extract robust features. These features are then encoded and decoded by an Exemplar LCA-Decoder, which is suitable for in-memory computation on neuromorphic platforms. The proposed approach achieves high accuracy on datasets like DVS128 while significantly reducing energy consumption compared to other spiking neural networks, making it ideal for energy-constrained applications like UAVs and robotics.",

STACI is highly scalable and provides statistically valid prediction intervals for uncertainty quantification. The method outperforms competing Gaussian Process and deep learning models in approximating spatio-temporal processes and can be scaled to datasets with millions of observations.",

The authors create three datasets modeling epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. They demonstrate the utility of these datasets by benchmarking several machine learning models and showing that pre-training on this synthetic data can improve performance on real-world epidemiological data. The provided methodology and datasets enable researchers to create customized benchmarks for various applications.",
