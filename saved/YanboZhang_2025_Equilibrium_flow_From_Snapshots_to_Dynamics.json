  "summary": "This work introduces the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous dynamics preserving a given pattern distribution. It investigates how static patterns from underlying dynamical systems, such as cellular snapshots or celestial distributions, constrain and allow for the recovery of their underlying dynamics.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17990v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper discusses recovering underlying dynamics from static patterns, which can be interpreted as spatio-temporal analysis of point-like data (e.g., celestial distributions), even if it doesn't explicitly use 'point process' terminology. The focus on dynamics and patterns implies spatio-temporal considerations."
