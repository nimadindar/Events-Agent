  "summary": "This paper presents Naomi, a spatial evidence synthesis model for producing district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. It jointly models multiple outcomes using household survey data and health system data, providing a tool for countries to generate estimates.",

  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions \"spatial evidence synthesis model\" and \"household survey data\", directly linking to \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Survey data\". The modeling of district-level indicators with survey data also implies a contextual aspect."
