It aims to diversify recommendations without negatively impacting core business metrics, aligning with an initiative to broaden the audience's cultural practices.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly uses \"personalized Determinantal Point Processes\", which is a direct application of \"Point Process\". While not explicitly spatio-temporal, the context of recommendations can involve implicit spatio-temporal aspects of user behavior."
