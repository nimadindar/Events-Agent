  "summary": "This paper proposes RnGCam, a system that fuses measurements from low-speed consumer-grade rolling-shutter and global-shutter sensors into video at kHz frame rates, enabling high-speed video reconstruction from compressive video capture.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18087v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper focuses on \"high-speed video\" and \"fuses measurements... into video at kHz frame rates\", which inherently involves both spatial and temporal dimensions, making it relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\"."
