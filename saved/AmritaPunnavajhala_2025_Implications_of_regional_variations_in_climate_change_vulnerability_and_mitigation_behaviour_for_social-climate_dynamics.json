  "summary": "This paper presents a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions, parameterized with geophysical, economic, and social survey data. It investigates how regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive and respond to climate dynamics, finding that support for mitigation evolves variably across regions based on socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions 'social survey data' and discusses 'regional variations' and 'social-climate dynamics', implying spatio-temporal aspects. While it doesn't use 'point process' terminology, the analysis of social data with spatial and temporal components makes it clearly relevant to 'Spatio Temporal' and 'Survey data'."
