  "summary": "This study introduces DeepSea MOT, a novel benchmark video dataset developed to evaluate the performance of multi-object tracking and object detection models in deep-sea environments. It facilitates consistent comparisons and aids in optimizing model performance for this specific contextual application.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03499v1",
  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly discusses the development of a \"benchmark video dataset\" for a specific context (deep-sea video), making it highly relevant to the concept of a \"Contextual dataset.\" It focuses on a dataset designed for a particular application and its contextual use."
