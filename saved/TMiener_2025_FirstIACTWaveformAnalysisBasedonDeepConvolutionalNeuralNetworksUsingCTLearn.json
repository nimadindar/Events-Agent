  "summary": "Imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) detect extended air showers (EASs) generated when very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays or cosmic rays interact with the Earth's atmosphere. Cherenkov photons produced during an EAS are captured by fast-imaging cameras, which record both the spatial and temporal development of the shower, along with calorimetric data.",

  "usefulness_reason": "The summary explicitly states that the cameras record \"both the spatial and temporal development of the shower\", which directly aligns with the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query."
