  "summary": "This paper proposes FASL-Seg, a model for anatomy and tool segmentation in surgical scenes, addressing the challenge of balancing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions 'capturing high-level contextual features', which is relevant to the 'Contextual dataset' aspect of the query."
