  "summary": "This paper introduces CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) during prompt tuning. It addresses the challenge of miscalibrated predictions in Med-VLMs, which can lead to overconfident errors and undermine clinical trust.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses \"confidence calibration\" and \"prompt learning\" for medical vision-language models. While not explicitly \"contextual dataset\", prompt learning often involves providing contextual information to guide the model. This makes it tangentially relevant to \"Contextual dataset\"."
