  "usefulness_reason": "The title directly mentions \"survey data\", which is one of the key search terms. While it doesn't explicitly mention spatio-temporal point processes, the use of machine learning on survey data could involve contextual datasets and potentially spatio-temporal aspects, making it relevant but not directly focused."
