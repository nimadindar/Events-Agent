  "summary": "This paper presents a sound-horizon-agnostic determination of the Hubble constant by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with CMB lensing measurements, galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample. The analysis treats the sound horizon at the drag epoch as a free parameter.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract mentions combining \"BAO data with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey Year-3 (3x2-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample.\" This clearly indicates the use of \"Survey data\" and a \"Contextual dataset\" (multiple datasets combined for a specific context)."
