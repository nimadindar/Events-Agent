  "summary": "This paper investigates the use of a single moving sensor to identify modal parameters of a bridge system under various loading conditions, including random traffic-induced vibrations. It focuses on analyzing dynamic response data in the frequency domain to determine natural frequencies and damping ratios.",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper deals with data collected from a 'single moving sensor' and 'random traffic-induced vibrations', which implies spatio-temporal data collection and analysis. The 'random traffic-induced vibrations' can be interpreted as a form of point process, and the data collection method is akin to a survey of the bridge's dynamic response."
