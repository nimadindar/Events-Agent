  "summary": "This paper investigates the quenching of simulated galaxies across cosmic time, focusing on intrinsic and environmental mechanisms. It provides predictions for the VLT-MOONRISE wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey, examining the quenching of central, high-mass, and low-mass satellites from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper discusses 'cosmic time' (temporal) and 'environmental' (spatial) aspects in the context of 'galaxy survey' data. While it doesn't explicitly mention 'point process', the spatio-temporal nature of the data and the use of survey data are relevant to the query."
