  "summary": "This study proposes a novel deep learning framework for improved classification of nitrogen stress severity in plants under combined stress conditions, utilizing a Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06625v1",
  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 90 assigned because the title directly mentions \"Spatio-Temporal Deep Learning Framework\", which is highly relevant to the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query. The application to plant stress classification also implies a contextual dataset."
