  "summary": "This paper proposes automating atomic data analysis by casting it as a Markov decision process and solving it with graph reinforcement learning. Reward functions are learned from historical human decisions to accelerate fine structure determination.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions 'Markov decision process', which is a type of stochastic process and can be related to point processes. The use of 'graph reinforcement learning' could imply some spatial or relational aspect, making it tangentially relevant to spatio-temporal concepts. Additionally, the 'atomic data' can be considered a contextual dataset."
