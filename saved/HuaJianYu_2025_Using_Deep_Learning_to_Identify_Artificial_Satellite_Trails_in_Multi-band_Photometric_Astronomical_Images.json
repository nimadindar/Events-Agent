  "summary": "This research addresses the growing challenge of artificial satellite trail interference in ground-based astronomical observations by developing an efficient deep learning identification method. It uses multi-band photometric survey observational data to accurately detect satellite trails and preserve astronomical data quality.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04081v1",
  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions \"photometric survey observational data\" which aligns with \"Survey data\". The identification of \"satellite trails\" can be interpreted as detecting spatio-temporal events, which has connections to \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Point Process\" concepts, even if not explicitly using those terms."
