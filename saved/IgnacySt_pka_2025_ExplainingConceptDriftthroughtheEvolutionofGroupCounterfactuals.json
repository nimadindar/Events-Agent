  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel methodology to explain concept drift by analyzing the temporal evolution of group-based counterfactual explanations (GCEs). The approach tracks shifts in GCEs' clusters to understand how and why a model's decision-making logic changes in dynamic environments.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The summary explicitly mentions 'temporal evolution' and 'dynamic environments' which directly relates to the temporal aspect of spatio-temporal. While not explicitly spatial, the temporal focus is strong enough to be relevant to the broader 'Spatio Temporal' topic."
