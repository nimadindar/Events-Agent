  "summary": "This paper introduces SpatialVID, a large-scale video dataset with spatial annotations, addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data for spatial intelligence, spatial reconstruction, and world exploration in real-world dynamic scenes.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09676v1",
  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper directly relates to \"Spatio Temporal\" through \"Spatial Annotations\" and \"real-world dynamic scenes\". The introduction of a \"Large-Scale Video Dataset\" is highly relevant to \"Contextual dataset\". While \"Point Process\" and \"Survey data\" are not explicitly mentioned, the core themes align well with the broader search criteria."
