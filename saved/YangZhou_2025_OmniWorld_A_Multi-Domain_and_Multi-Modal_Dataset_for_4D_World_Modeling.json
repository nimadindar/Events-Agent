  "summary": "This paper introduces OmniWorld, a multi-domain and multi-modal dataset designed for 4D world modeling. It aims to capture spatial geometry and temporal dynamics, addressing the limitations of existing datasets in dynamic complexity, multi-domain diversity, and spatial-temporal annotations.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12201v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper directly addresses 'Spatio Temporal' through its focus on 'spatial geometry and temporal dynamics' and '4D world modeling'. The mention of 'Multi-Domain and Multi-Modal Dataset' also aligns with 'Contextual dataset'. While 'Point Process' is not explicitly mentioned, the nature of 4D world modeling and spatio-temporal data often involves point-based representations or events."
