  "summary": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. This paper explores a zero-shot solution in STVG using multimodal large language models (MLLMs), revealing insights into MLLMs' dynamic assignment of grounding tokens and their challenges in fully integrating temporal information.",

  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title explicitly mentions \"Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding\" and the summary reinforces this by stating its aim to \"localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video\". This directly aligns with the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query."
