  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on \"Dataset Acquisition\" for \"multimodal data\". While not explicitly \"contextual dataset\" or \"survey data\" in the traditional sense, multimodal data often contains contextual information. The emphasis on data acquisition makes it relevant to the \"dataset\" aspect of the query."
