  "summary": "This paper presents a multi-temporal dataset of high-resolution registered point clouds for maize and tomato plants, providing approximately 260 million labeled 3D points. The dataset aims to advance research in plant phenotyping, 3D reconstruction, non-rigid registration, and deep learning on raw point clouds.",

  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 85 assigned because the article directly discusses a 'spatio-temporal dataset' and 'point clouds', which are highly relevant to spatio-temporal data and point processes, and also mentions 'dataset'."
