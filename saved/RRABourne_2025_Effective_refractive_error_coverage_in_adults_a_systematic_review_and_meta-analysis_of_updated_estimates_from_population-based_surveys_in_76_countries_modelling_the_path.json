  "summary": "This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of population-based eye surveys from 76 countries to model global and regional estimates of effective refractive error coverage (eREC) in adults. It evaluates progress towards the WHO global target for eREC by 2030, utilizing data from numerous surveys.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper is a 'systematic review and meta-analysis of updated estimates from population-based surveys', directly addressing the 'Survey data' keyword. It also mentions 'global and regional estimates', which has some relevance to 'Spatio Temporal', though not its primary focus."
