  "summary": "This paper presents a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions, parameterized with geophysical, economic, and social survey data, to study how regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive and respond to climate dynamics.",

  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly uses \"social survey data\" and discusses \"regional variations\" which implies a contextual dataset. While it doesn't directly mention \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\", the use of survey data in a spatially stratified model makes it relevant to the broader search."
