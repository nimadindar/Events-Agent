  "summary": "This paper investigates the effects of time dependence on the second-order coherence of pulsed light. It calculates the distribution of photon arrival time differences, showing strong bunching, and explains how to account for pulse shape.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Clearly relevant to \"Temporal\" aspect due to \"time dependence\" and \"temporal distribution of photons\". While not explicitly \"spatio\", the concept of photon arrival times can be considered a point process in time. The \"distribution of photon arrival time differences\" is a key indicator."
