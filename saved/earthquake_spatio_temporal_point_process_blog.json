  "summary": "This article uses point process modeling, specifically the Hawkes process (a self-excited point process model), to understand earthquake sequences in space-time. It considers spatial, temporal, and covariate effects, which are relevant to contextual data.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 95 assigned because the article directly discusses \"Point process modeling\" and \"self-excited point process model\" (Hawkes process) in the context of \"space-time\" for earthquake sequences, which is highly relevant to \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\". It also mentions \"covariate effects\" which can be related to contextual data."
