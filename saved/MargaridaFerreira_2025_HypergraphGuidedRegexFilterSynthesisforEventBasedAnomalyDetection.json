  "summary": "This paper proposes HyGLAD, an algorithm that automatically builds interpretable patterns to model event data for detecting event-based anomalies in stationary systems.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06911v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions \"model event data\" and \"event-based anomalies\". 'Event data' can be considered a form of point process data, and the modeling of it for anomaly detection implies the use of contextual information."
