  "summary": "This article introduces autocorrelograms for time series of point processes, which often arise from slicing longer temporal or spatio-temporal point processes into smaller time units, assuming a doubly-stochastic Poisson model with log-Gaussian intensity functions.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08070v2",
  "usefulness_score": 100,
  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract explicitly mentions \"spatio-temporal point process\" and the paper focuses on autocorrelation functions for point-process time series, directly addressing the core of the search query."
