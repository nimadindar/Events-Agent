  "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations. Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic d",

  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses a dataset for autonomous vehicle behavior and naturalistic trajectories, which involves spatio-temporal data. However, it does not explicitly mention 'point process', 'contextual dataset' in a general sense, or 'survey data'. The focus is on dataset validation rather than the theoretical or methodological aspects of spatio-temporal point processes."
