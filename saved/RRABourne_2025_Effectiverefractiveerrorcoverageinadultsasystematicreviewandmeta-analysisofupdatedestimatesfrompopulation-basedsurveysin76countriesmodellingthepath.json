  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 75 assigned because the paper is a \"systematic review and meta-analysis of updated estimates from population-based surveys,\" directly addressing the \"Survey data\" keyword. It does not, however, focus on spatio-temporal point processes or contextual datasets."
