  "summary": "This paper introduces WenetSpeech-Chuan, a 10,000-hour, richly annotated corpus for Sichuanese dialects, addressing the scarcity of large-scale, open-source data for dialectal speech processing. It also presents the Chuan-Pipeline, a data processing framework, and high-quality evaluation sets.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18004v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper focuses on creating a 'large-scale corpus' which is a type of 'contextual dataset'. While not directly about spatio-temporal point processes or survey data, the creation and annotation of a specialized dataset aligns with the broader theme of contextual data."
