  "summary": "This article develops a mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modeling individual-level spatio-temporal data, rooted in spatio-temporal point processes. It views transmission processes as marked spatio-temporal point processes.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article is highly relevant as it explicitly discusses a 'mechanistic spatio-temporal framework' and states that the approach is 'rooted in spatio-temporal point processes'. It directly addresses 'Spatio Temporal Point Process' and mentions 'individual-level spatio-temporal data', which is a type of contextual dataset."
