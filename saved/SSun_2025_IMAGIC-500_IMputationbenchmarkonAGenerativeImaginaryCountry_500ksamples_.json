  "summary": "This study introduces IMAGIC-500, a synthetic dataset derived from a World Bank household survey, designed for benchmarking missing data imputation methods in socioeconomic research. It reflects the hierarchical structure of real-world household surveys and provides a comprehensive benchmark under various missing mechanisms and ratios.",

  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 85 assigned because the paper directly focuses on 'missing data imputation in tabular datasets' within 'socioeconomic research' and utilizes a 'World Bank household survey' to create a benchmark dataset, making it highly relevant to 'Contextual dataset' and 'Survey data'."
