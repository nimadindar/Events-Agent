  "summary": "This blog post introduces a Spatio-temporal Poisson ANOVA model (SPAM) for Bayesian spatio-temporal disease mapping of COVID-19. It emphasizes the importance of spatio-temporal analysis in understanding disease dynamics and identifying patterns over time and across spatial units.",

  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 90 assigned because the post explicitly mentions \"Spatio-temporal Poisson ANOVA model\" and \"Spatio-temporal disease mapping,\" directly linking to \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Point Process\" (Poisson process is a type of point process). This makes it highly relevant."
