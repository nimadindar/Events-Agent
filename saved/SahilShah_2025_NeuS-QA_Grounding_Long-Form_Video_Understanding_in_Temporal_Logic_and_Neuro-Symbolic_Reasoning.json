  "summary": "This paper addresses challenges in Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) by proposing NeuS-QA, a framework that grounds long-form video understanding in temporal logic and neuro-symbolic reasoning. It aims to overcome limitations of current vision-language models in handling complex queries and multi-step temporal reasoning over long videos.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper explicitly deals with \"Long-Form Video Question Answering\" and \"multi-step temporal reasoning\" over \"long videos\", which are strong indicators of both spatial (video content) and temporal aspects, making it highly relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\"."
