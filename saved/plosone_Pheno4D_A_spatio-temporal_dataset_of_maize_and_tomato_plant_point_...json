  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article is relevant because it presents a 'spatio-temporal dataset' and discusses 'point cloud processing', which relates to 'point process' and 'contextual dataset' in a broader sense. While not directly about spatio-temporal point processes, it covers related concepts."
