  "summary": "This paper introduces Drivelology, a linguistic phenomenon of \"nonsense with depth\" that requires contextual inference, moral reasoning, or emotional interpretation, and challenges LLMs to interpret such expressions.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03867v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions \"contextual inference\", which is relevant to the 'Contextual dataset' aspect of the query."
