  "usefulness_reason": "The title and content mention 'spatio-temporal scales' and 'temporal mobility patterns' which is relevant to 'Spatio Temporal'. It also discusses 'smart-card data' which can be considered a type of contextual dataset. However, it doesn't explicitly mention 'Point Process' or 'Survey data'."
