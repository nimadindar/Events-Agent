  "summary": "This paper investigates galaxy quenching across cosmic time using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, providing predictions for the VLT-MOONRISE wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey. It examines the roles of intrinsic and environmental mechanisms in quenching centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass satellites.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses a \"wide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey\" which directly relates to \"Survey data\". The context of galaxy evolution across \"cosmic time\" implies spatio-temporal aspects, although \"point process\" is not explicitly mentioned."
