  "summary": "This paper introduces a novel framework for oppression measurement that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate context-sensitive scores of lived historical oppression. It addresses the challenges of cross-national validity in measuring historical structural oppression, which traditionally relied on structured indices.",

  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on generating \"context-sensitive scores\" using LLMs to measure historical structural oppression. This directly relates to the concept of a \"Contextual dataset\" as it involves extracting and utilizing contextual information from text to create meaningful data points."
