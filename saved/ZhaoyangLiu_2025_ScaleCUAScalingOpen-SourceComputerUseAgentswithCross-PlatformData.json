  "summary": "This work introduces ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source computer use agents (CUAs) by offering a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains. The dataset is built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts, addressing the limitation of lacking large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "This paper introduces a \"large-scale dataset\" for computer use agents, built with \"human experts\". This is highly relevant to \"Contextual dataset\" and could be considered a form of \"Survey data\" if the human expert input is gathered through a survey-like process."
