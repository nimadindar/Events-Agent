  "summary": "This paper presents xGFabric, a system for coupling distributed sensor networks with high-performance computing facilities using private 5G wireless networks for real-time digital agriculture. It addresses the need for monitoring environmental conditions and detecting damage in citrus research facilities.",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses \"distributed sensor networks\" and \"real-time\" monitoring of \"environmental conditions\", which implies spatio-temporal data and a contextual dataset. While it doesn't explicitly use \"point process\", the nature of sensor events over space and time is relevant to the broader theme."
