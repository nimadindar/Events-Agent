It addresses the challenge of diagnosing the capacity of vision-language models for deep, narrative comprehension by evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content, filling a gap in existing benchmarks.",

  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 80 assigned because the title explicitly mentions \"Contextual Movie Question Answering Benchmark\" and the summary describes a \"comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding\" which is a \"dataset\". This directly aligns with the 'Contextual dataset' aspect of the search query."
