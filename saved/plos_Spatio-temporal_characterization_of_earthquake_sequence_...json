  "summary": "This blog post discusses the use of point process modeling, specifically the ETAS model (Hawkes process), for spatio-temporal characterization of earthquake sequences. It highlights how these models can help understand interactions between earthquakes and spatial, temporal, and covariate effects.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 95 assigned because the post directly discusses \"Point Process modeling,\" \"Spatio-temporal\" aspects, and specifically mentions \"Hawkes process\" which is a type of spatio-temporal point process, making it highly relevant to the query."
