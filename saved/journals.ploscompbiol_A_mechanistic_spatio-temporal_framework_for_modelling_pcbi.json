  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title explicitly mentions \"spatio-temporal framework for modelling\" and the content directly discusses \"nonhomogeneous Poisson processes\" and \"stationary point processes\", which are core to \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\". It also mentions \"data generated from a null model\" and \"Population Density Data\", which can be considered a \"Contextual dataset\"."
