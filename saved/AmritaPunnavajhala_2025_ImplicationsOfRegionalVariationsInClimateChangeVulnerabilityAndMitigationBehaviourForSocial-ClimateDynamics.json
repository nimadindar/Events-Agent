  "summary": "This paper presents a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions, parameterized with geophysical, economic, and social survey data. It investigates how regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive and respond to climate dynamics, finding that support for mitigation evolves variably across regions based on socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and temperature feedback.",

  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 75 assigned because the paper uses 'social survey data' and discusses 'regional heterogeneity' and 'climate dynamics,' implying spatio-temporal aspects. While 'point process' and 'contextual dataset' are not explicitly mentioned, the use of survey data in a spatio-temporal context makes it relevant to the user's request."
