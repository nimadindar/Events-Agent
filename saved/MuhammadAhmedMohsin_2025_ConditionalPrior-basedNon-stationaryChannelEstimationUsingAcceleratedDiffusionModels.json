  "summary": "This work proposes conditional prior diffusion for channel estimation in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings, where wireless channels are non-stationary and mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over time. A temporal encoder with cross-time attention compresses a short observation window into a context vector, capturing the channel's instantaneous coherence.",

  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract mentions \"Wireless channels in motion-rich urban microcell (UMi) settings are non-stationary; mobility and scatterer dynamics shift the distribution over time\". This clearly indicates a spatio-temporal aspect. While it doesn't explicitly mention \"point process\" or \"contextual dataset\" or \"survey data\", the focus on spatio-temporal dynamics makes it relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\"."
