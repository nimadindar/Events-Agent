  "summary": "This paper addresses the functional deficiencies and security vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code by proposing ImportSnare, a method that enhances correctness and security through directed \"code manual\" hijacking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\" and leveraging \"external code manuals\" to improve code generation. These \"code manuals\" can be considered a form of contextual dataset that provides relevant information for the task, making it tangentially relevant to 'Contextual dataset'."
