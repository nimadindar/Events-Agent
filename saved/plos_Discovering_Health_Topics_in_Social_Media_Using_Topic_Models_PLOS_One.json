  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The post discusses 'social media' as a source of data, which can be considered a contextual dataset. It also mentions 'self-reported health statuses', which is akin to survey data. While it doesn't explicitly mention 'Spatio Temporal' or 'Point Process', the aggregation of data across millions of users implies some form of spatial and temporal distribution, even if not the primary focus."
