  "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of creating large-scale verifiable training datasets for issue-resolving tasks. It proposes SWE-Mirror, a method to scale issue-resolving datasets by mirroring issues across repositories, maximizing the utilization of existing Gym environments and rich data from human-reported problems.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title and summary explicitly mention \"datasets\" and \"scaling issue-resolving datasets\", which directly relates to the \"Contextual dataset\" aspect of the query. While it doesn't mention spatio-temporal or point processes, the focus on dataset creation and utilization makes it relevant."
