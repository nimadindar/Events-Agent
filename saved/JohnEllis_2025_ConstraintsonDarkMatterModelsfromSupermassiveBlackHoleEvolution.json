  "summary": "This paper uses JWST and pre-JWST observations to constrain dark matter models based on stellar mass-BH mass relations, reproducing high-redshift SMBH data.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06955v1",
  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper explicitly refers to \"JWST and pre-JWST observations\" and \"high-redshift SMBH data\", which are types of survey data used for analysis."
