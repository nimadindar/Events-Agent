  "summary": "This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 237 population-based eye surveys across 76 countries to model global and regional estimates of effective refractive error coverage (eREC). The research aims to evaluate progress towards the WHO global target for eREC by 2030, using survey data to calculate eREC and the relative quality gap.",
