  "summary": "This paper explores dynamic spatial resource management and real-time adaptation in vehicular networks through the integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), addressing challenges in unified reliability modeling and resource optimization.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06763v2",
  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions \"dynamic spatial resource management\" and \"real-time adaptation to environmental changes\" and \"highly dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies\", which are all strong indicators of spatio-temporal aspects."
