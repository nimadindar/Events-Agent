  "summary": "This post discusses the use of point process modeling, specifically the ETAS model (Hawkes process), for spatio-temporal characterization of earthquake sequences. It highlights how earthquake events can be viewed as points in space and time, and how these models help understand interactions between earthquakes and spatial/temporal features.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 95 assigned because the post directly discusses 'Point process modeling' and 'spatio-temporal' aspects in the context of earthquake sequences, which aligns strongly with 'Spatio Temporal Point Process' and 'Point Process'."
