  "summary": "This post discusses how citizen scientists collect data with spatial and temporal biases, leading to gaps and redundancies. It argues for a tractable framework to improve big citizen science data.",

  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "The post mentions 'spatial and temporal biases' in data collection, which is relevant to 'Spatio Temporal'. 'Citizen science data' can be considered a contextual dataset. The discussion of sampling and data collection methods is broadly related to survey data, even if not explicitly called 'survey data'. However, 'Point Process' is not mentioned."
