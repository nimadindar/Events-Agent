It covers spatial distribution patterns, sentiment analyses, characteristics of urban scenic areas, spatiotemporal distribution of tourists, and tourist evaluation models based on various user-generated content and mobile data.",

      "usefulness_score": 50,
      "usefulness_reason": "Score 50 assigned because the article discusses 'spatiotemporal data' and uses 'multi-source data' which aligns with 'Contextual dataset' and 'Survey data' in a broad sense. However, it does not explicitly focus on 'Point Process' or 'Spatio Temporal Point Process', making it tangentially relevant rather than directly focused on all aspects of the query."
