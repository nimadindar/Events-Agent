  "summary": "This paper addresses challenges in trajectory prediction due to incomplete and noisy observational data from out-of-sight objects and sensor limitations. It focuses on tracking, fusion, and prediction, highlighting the need for robust methods to handle inherent noise and limited ground truth.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses \"observational data\" and \"sensor data\" in the context of trajectory prediction, which can be considered a form of \"Contextual dataset\". It also highlights challenges with data quality and completeness, which are relevant to dataset considerations."
