  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper analyzes data from \"LHAASO, a ground-based observatory,\" which is a type of scientific survey. The data analyzed, \"high energy diffuse \\gamma-rays from the Galactic plane,\" can be considered a form of survey data, making it relevant to the 'Survey data' aspect of the query."
