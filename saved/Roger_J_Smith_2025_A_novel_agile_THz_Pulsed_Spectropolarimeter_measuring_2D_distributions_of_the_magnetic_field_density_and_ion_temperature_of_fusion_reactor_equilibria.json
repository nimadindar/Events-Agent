  "summary": "This paper introduces a THz Pulsed Spectropolarimeter for non-perturbative measurements of internal local magnetic fields in fusion devices. It resolves 2D distributions of magnetic field and density, analogous to RADAR measurements of precipitation, to determine FRC midplane profiles.",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract mentions \"2D distributions\" and \"spatial distribution,\" which directly relates to \"Spatio Temporal.\" While \"temporal\" isn't explicitly stated, measurements of dynamic phenomena often imply a temporal aspect."
