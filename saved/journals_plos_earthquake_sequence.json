  "summary": "This article uses point process modeling, specifically the ETAS model (Hawkes process), to understand spatio-temporal interactions and covariate effects in earthquake sequences. It views each earthquake as a point in space, time, and magnitude, and discusses the self-excited nature of these events.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 95 assigned because the article directly discusses 'Point process modeling' and 'self-excited point process model' (ETAS model/Hawkes process) in the context of 'space-time' for earthquake sequences, which is highly relevant to 'Spatio Temporal Point Process'."
