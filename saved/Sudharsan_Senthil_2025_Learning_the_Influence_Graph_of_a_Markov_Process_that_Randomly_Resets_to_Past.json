  "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of learning the influence graph of a high-dimensional Markov process, particularly when the system probabilistically 'jumps back in time'. It explores a more general regime of Markov processes with memory.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16129v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly discusses 'Markov process', which is a fundamental concept in 'Point Process'. The notion of 'jumps back in time' introduces a temporal aspect, and 'influence graph' can imply a spatial or relational structure, making it relevant to 'Spatio Temporal' concepts."
