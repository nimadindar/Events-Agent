  "summary": "Multimodal large language models struggle with complex geometric problems due to a lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. This paper introduces a method to bridge this gap, as most template-based data synthesis pipelines fail to generalize beyond predefined templates.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper addresses the \"lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets\" for geometric problems, which is relevant to the \"Contextual dataset\" aspect of the query. While not directly about spatio-temporal point processes or survey data, it deals with the creation and challenges of a specific type of dataset."
