  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper uses \"survey data\" from multiple waves and across 16 countries, which directly relates to \"Survey data\" and implies a \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect due to the evolution of perceptions over time and across different countries. The focus on public perceptions also suggests a \"Contextual dataset\"."
