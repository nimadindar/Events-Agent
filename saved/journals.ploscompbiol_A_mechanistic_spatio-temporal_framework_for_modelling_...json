  "summary": "This paper proposes a mechanistic spatio-temporal framework for modeling, comparing estimated L(r) values to those from a Poisson point process, and discussing statistical inference for spatial processes.",

  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article explicitly mentions \"spatio-temporal framework\" and \"Poisson point process\" and \"stationary point processes\". This is directly and substantially about \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\" and \"Point Process\". It's an academic paper, not a blog post, but the content is highly relevant."
