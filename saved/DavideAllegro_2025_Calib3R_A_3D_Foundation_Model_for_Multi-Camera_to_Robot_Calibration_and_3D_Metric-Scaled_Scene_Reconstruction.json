  "summary": "This paper introduces Calib3R, a 3D Foundation Model for multi-camera to robot calibration and 3D metric-scaled scene reconstruction. It addresses the need for accurate 3D scene representation from RGB images for robot interaction tasks.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The summary mentions \"3D scene representation\" and \"RGB images\" which implies a contextual dataset with spatial information. While not explicitly spatio-temporal point process or survey data, the focus on 3D scene data makes it relevant to \"Contextual dataset\"."
