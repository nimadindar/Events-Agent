  "summary": "This study investigates the impact of satellite node failures on inter-satellite networking over time, considering the global reach and dynamic nature of mega-satellite constellations.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06766v1",
  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 75 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions \"globally\" and \"over time\", indicating spatio-temporal aspects of satellite networking and node failures. This is relevant to spatio-temporal analysis."
