  "summary": "This paper introduces FinZero, a framework for multi-modal financial time series forecasting using a large reasoning model. It addresses the challenges of information loss from data standardization and limitations of fixed variable numbers or lookback window lengths in traditional time series models.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08742v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper focuses on \"Financial Time Series Forecast\" and \"Multi-modal\" data, which aligns with the \"Spatio Temporal\" (primarily temporal) and \"Contextual dataset\" aspects of the query. While not explicitly a point process, the temporal nature is relevant."
