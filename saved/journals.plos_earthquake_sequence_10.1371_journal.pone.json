  "summary": "This article uses point process modeling to understand interactions between earthquakes and spatial, temporal, and covariate effects. It views each earthquake as a point related to space (latitude and longitude coordinates), time of occurrence, and magnitude. It discusses the ETAS model (Hawkes process) as a self-excited point process model.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "This article directly discusses \"Point process modeling\" and \"spatio-temporal\" aspects in the context of earthquake sequences, which aligns very well with \"Spatio Temporal Point Process\" and \"Spatio Temporal\". It also mentions \"covariate effects,\" which can be related to contextual data."
