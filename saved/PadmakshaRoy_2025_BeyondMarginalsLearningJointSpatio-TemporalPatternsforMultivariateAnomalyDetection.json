  "summary": "This paper aims to improve multivariate anomaly detection by modeling time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations in multivariate time series data, where anomalies may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time series from their expected collective behavior.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title explicitly mentions \"Spatio-Temporal Patterns\" and the abstract further elaborates on \"time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations\" in multivariate time series data. This is a direct and substantial match for the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query."
