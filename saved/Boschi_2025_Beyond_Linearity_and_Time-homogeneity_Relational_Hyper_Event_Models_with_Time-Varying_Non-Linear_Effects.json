  "summary": "This paper introduces Relational Hyper Event Models (RHEMs) to explain the dynamics of large and complex networks of time-stamped relational events. It aims to move beyond linearity and time-homogeneity assumptions by modeling event rates as a function of past history and external information.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05289v2",
  "usefulness_score": 80,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper directly addresses 'time-stamped relational events' and 'event rate', which are core concepts in point processes and spatio-temporal analysis. The mention of 'external information' also aligns with contextual data."
