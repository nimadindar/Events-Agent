  "summary": "This paper introduces RadarSFD, a conditional latent diffusion framework that reconstructs dense LiDAR-like point clouds from a single radar frame. It aims to improve radar imaging resolution without relying on synthetic aperture or multi-frame aggregation, making it practical for small robotic platforms.",

  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 85 assigned because the title explicitly mentions 'Radar Point Clouds', which directly relates to 'Point Process' and inherently involves spatial data. The context of radar and single-frame processing also implies a spatio-temporal aspect, as radar data is often collected sequentially over time."
