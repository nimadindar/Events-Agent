  "summary": "This paper introduces extensions to Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection (BOCPD) to infer soil drydown behavior from continuous soil-moisture measurements. The model captures piecewise dynamics and accommodates unknown parameters, using a particle-filter approach for realistic inference of segment-specific behaviors over time.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13293v1",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper deals with continuous soil-moisture measurements, which can be considered spatio-temporal data. The 'piecewise dynamics' and 'changepoint detection' relate to modeling events over time and space, showing some overlap with point processes, although it's not explicitly a point process paper."
