  "summary": "This paper proposes a lightweight and accurate multi-view stereo method using a confidence-aware diffusion model to reconstruct 3D geometry from calibrated images. It focuses on improving computational efficiency by initializing a coarse depth map and refining it iteratively.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The abstract mentions \"fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud\". While \"point cloud\" is mentioned, it's in the context of 3D geometry reconstruction, not a statistical \"point process\". However, the term \"point\" is present, making it tangentially relevant to \"Point Process\"."
