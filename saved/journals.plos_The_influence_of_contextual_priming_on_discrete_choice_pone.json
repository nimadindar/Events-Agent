  "usefulness_reason": "The title mentions \"contextual priming\" and the content extensively discusses \"Survey design and administration\" and \"context in which a survey takes place\", directly addressing \"Contextual dataset\" and \"Survey data\". While it doesn't explicitly mention spatio-temporal point processes, the contextual nature of survey data can be relevant."
