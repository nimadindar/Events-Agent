  "summary": "This paper introduces a Contextualized Representation Learning Network to enhance Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. It integrates affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions, addressing challenges from incomplete context modeling in existing two-stage approaches.",

  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions \"Contextualized Representations\" and \"incomplete context modeling\", directly aligning with the \"Contextual dataset\" aspect of the query. While it doesn't directly address spatio-temporal point processes or survey data, its focus on contextual information is relevant."
