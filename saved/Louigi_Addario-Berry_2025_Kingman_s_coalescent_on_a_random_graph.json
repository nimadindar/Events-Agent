  "summary": "This paper introduces a generalization of Kingman's coalescent on a graph, building on a forest-valued representation. It describes how trees merge based on connections in the graph, extending the standard Kingman coalescent.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16181v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly discusses 'Kingman's coalescent' and 'process', which are directly related to 'Point Process'. While not explicitly 'spatio-temporal', coalescent processes inherently involve a temporal dimension, and the 'on a random graph' aspect introduces a structural or potentially spatial context, making it relevant to the broader topic of point processes."
