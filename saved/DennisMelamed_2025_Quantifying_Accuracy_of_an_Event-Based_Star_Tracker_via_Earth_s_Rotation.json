  "summary": "This paper analyzes the accuracy of an event-based camera (EBC) star tracking system by utilizing Earth's motion as ground truth. It focuses on detecting and tracking events (stars) in space and time, which is relevant to spatio-temporal analysis and potentially point processes.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08794v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper discusses \"Event-based cameras\" and \"star tracking\", which involves detecting events in space and time, making it relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\". The \"event-based\" nature also suggests a connection to \"Point Process\" concepts."
