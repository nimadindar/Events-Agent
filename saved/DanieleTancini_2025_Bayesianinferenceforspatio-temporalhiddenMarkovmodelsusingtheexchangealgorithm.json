  "summary": "This work proposes a spatio-temporal hidden Markov model where the latent process is an extension of the autologistic model, addressing the difficulty of estimating spatio-temporal hidden Markov models due to their latent joint distributions being available only in trivial cases.",

  "usefulness_score": 95,
  "usefulness_reason": "The title explicitly mentions \"spatio-temporal hidden Markov models\" and the summary further elaborates on the challenges and proposed solutions for these models. This is a direct and substantial match for the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query."
