  "summary": "This work presents Raw2Event, a hardware-software system enabling real-time event generation from low-cost raw frame cameras, leveraging event cameras' high temporal resolution for vision tasks.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06767v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the summary explicitly mentions \"high temporal resolution\" of event cameras, which is directly relevant to the \"Spatio Temporal\" aspect of the query."
