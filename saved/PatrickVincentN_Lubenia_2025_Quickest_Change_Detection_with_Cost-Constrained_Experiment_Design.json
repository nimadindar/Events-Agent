  "summary": "This paper addresses the quickest change detection problem where an observer monitors a stochastic process and, at each observation time, chooses between multiple experiments with varying information qualities and costs. The objective is to minimize the worst-case average detection delay under false alarm and cost constraints.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14186v1",
  "usefulness_score": 60,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 60 assigned because the paper discusses monitoring a \"stochastic process\" and \"at each observation time, the decision-maker needs to choose between multiple experiments\". This aligns with the concept of a \"Point Process\" where events occur at specific times. While not explicitly spatio-temporal, the temporal aspect of a point process is present."
