  "summary": "This paper focuses on benchmarking Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for scene understanding in social robot navigation, specifically inferring spatial-temporal aspects of complex social navigation scenes. It highlights the need for robust scene understanding in dynamic, human-centered environments.",

  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "The summary explicitly mentions \"inferring the spatial-temporal\" aspects of scenes and \"benchmarking\" which implies the use of a dataset, making it relevant to \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Contextual dataset\"."
