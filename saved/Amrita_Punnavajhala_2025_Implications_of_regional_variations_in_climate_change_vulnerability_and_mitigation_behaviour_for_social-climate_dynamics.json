  "summary": "This paper presents a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions, parameterized with geophysical, economic, and social survey data. It investigates how regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive and respond to climate dynamics, finding that support for mitigation evolves variably across regions based on socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and temperature feedback.",

  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 65 assigned because the paper utilizes 'social survey data' and discusses 'regional variations' and how support for mitigation 'evolves', implying spatio-temporal aspects. However, it does not explicitly mention 'point process' or 'spatio-temporal point process'."
