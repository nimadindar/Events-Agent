  "summary": "This paper addresses multi-robot multi-source localization in complex, time-varying flows, where sensor readings are sporadic and intermittent. It focuses on accurately accounting for physical processes driving dispersion dynamics using physics-preserving environment models.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14228v1",
  "usefulness_score": 85,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 85 assigned because the paper deals with \"multi-source localization in complex flows\" with \"time-varying and chaotic\" dynamics and \"sporadic and intermittent sensor readings\". This strongly aligns with \"Spatio Temporal\" and the nature of the sensor readings suggests a \"Point Process\" interpretation of events in space and time."
