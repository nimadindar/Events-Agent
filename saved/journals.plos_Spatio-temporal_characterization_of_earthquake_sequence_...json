  "summary": "This study uses point process modeling to understand interactions between earthquakes and spatial, temporal, and covariate effects, viewing each earthquake as a point related to space, time, and magnitude.",

  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 90 assigned because the article explicitly mentions 'Point process modeling', 'spatio-temporal characterization', and treats each earthquake event as a 'point related to space (latitude and longitude coordinates), time of occurrence, and magnitude', directly aligning with the core concepts of spatio-temporal point processes."
