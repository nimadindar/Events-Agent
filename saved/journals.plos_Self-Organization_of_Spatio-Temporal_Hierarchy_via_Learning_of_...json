  "usefulness_reason": "The title and content directly address 'Spatio-Temporal Hierarchy' and 'Contextual recognition,' making it highly relevant to spatio-temporal data and contextual datasets. While not explicitly about point processes or survey data, the core concepts align well with the broader search."
