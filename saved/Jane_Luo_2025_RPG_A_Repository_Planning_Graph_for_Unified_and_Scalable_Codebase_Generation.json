  "summary": "This paper introduces the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a persistent representation for unifying proposal- and implementation-level planning in codebase generation. It aims to address the challenge of generating complete repositories from scratch with coherent and reliable planning.",

  "usefulness_score": 30,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper discusses 'codebase generation' and 'software structures', which are not directly related to 'Spatio Temporal Point Process', 'Spatio Temporal', 'Point Process', 'Contextual dataset', or 'Survey data'. While it deals with 'data' in a broad sense, it's not the specific type of contextual or survey data relevant to the query."
