  "summary": "This study explores spatio-temporal transitions in cross-country road traffic volumes to model behavioral transitions in car-based human mobility. It reports on individual car-based daily travel behavior detected before and during the pandemic era, providing data insights from a cross-border region in Europe.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05166v2",
  "usefulness_score": 65,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper explicitly mentions 'spatio-temporal transitions' and 'road traffic data' which aligns with spatio-temporal analysis. The 'data insight' and 'human-mobility' aspects suggest a connection to contextual or survey-like data, although 'point process' is not directly mentioned."
