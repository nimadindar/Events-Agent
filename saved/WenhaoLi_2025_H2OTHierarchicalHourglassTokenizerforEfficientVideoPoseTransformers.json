  "summary": "This paper introduces H$_{2}$OT, a hierarchical pruning-and-recovering framework for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos, addressing the high computational costs of video pose transformers.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956v1",
  "usefulness_score": 70,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 70 assigned because the paper directly addresses \"video-based 3D human pose estimation\" and \"video pose transformers,\" which are inherently spatio-temporal in nature. The processing of video data explicitly involves both spatial and temporal dimensions."
