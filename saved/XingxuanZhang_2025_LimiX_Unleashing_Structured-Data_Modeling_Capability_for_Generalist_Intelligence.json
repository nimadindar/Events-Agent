  "summary": "This report introduces LimiX, a large structured-data model (LDM) designed to advance general intelligence by grounding foundation models in structured data. LimiX models structured data as a joint distribution over variables and missingness, enabling it to handle various tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction.",

  "usefulness_score": 55,
  "usefulness_reason": "The paper focuses on 'structured data' and 'large structured-data models', which can be a component of contextual datasets. However, it does not explicitly discuss 'contextual dataset' as a primary topic or delve into the methodologies of incorporating context into datasets in a general sense. Its relevance is more indirect."
