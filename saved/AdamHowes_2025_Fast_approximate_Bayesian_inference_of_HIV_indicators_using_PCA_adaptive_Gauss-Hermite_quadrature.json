  "summary": "This paper introduces Naomi, a spatial evidence synthesis model for producing district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. It jointly models multiple policy outcomes using both household survey data and routinely reported health system data, providing a tool for countries to generate estimates.",
  "url": "http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15665v1",
  "usefulness_score": 90,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 90 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions a \"spatial evidence synthesis model\" and uses \"household survey data\" and \"routinely reported health system data\" to produce \"district-level HIV epidemic indicators\". This directly addresses \"Spatio Temporal\" and \"Survey data\", and the district-level indicators can be considered a form of \"Contextual dataset\"."
