  "summary": "This paper introduces MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, crucial for precision agriculture. It addresses the scarcity of curated datasets for accurate maize seedling detection, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management.",

  "usefulness_reason": "The paper introduces a \"curated high-resolution RGB dataset\" for \"maize seedling detection\" and \"stand counting\". This directly relates to \"Contextual dataset\" and potentially \"Survey data\" in the context of agricultural monitoring. While not a spatio-temporal point process, it's a relevant dataset."
