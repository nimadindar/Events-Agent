  "summary": "This paper introduces Naomi, a spatial evidence synthesis model for producing district-level HIV epidemic indicators in sub-Saharan Africa. It jointly models multiple outcomes using household survey data and routinely reported health system data, providing a tool for countries to generate estimates.",
  "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15665v1",
  "usefulness_score": 75,
  "usefulness_reason": "Score 75 assigned because the paper explicitly mentions a 'spatial evidence synthesis model' and utilizes 'household survey data' to produce 'district-level HIV epidemic indicators'. This directly relates to 'Spatio Temporal' (through 'spatial' and epidemic indicators evolving over time) and 'Survey data'. The district-level data can be considered a 'Contextual dataset'. While 'point process' is not explicitly stated, the nature of epidemic indicators often involves counting events in space and time."
