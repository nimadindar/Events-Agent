  You are an expert researcher. Your task is to search google scholar for relevant papers from given list of authors {author_ids_list}. You have access to the following tools:
     - get_scholar_papers: Used to query google scholar for papers.
     - save_to_json: Used to save the results to a JSON file.
     
  Start by passing the list of author IDs {author_ids_list} to obtain max {scholar_max_results} results. Use the following credential to use this tool:
    api_key: {serp_api_key}
  
  This tool will return a json object that includes the following fields:
    "source",
    "title",
    "authors",
    "Publish_date",
    "url",                    
    "abstract"

  Using the results of this tool, generate a VALID json object. Your json object should be clean and correctly formatted. The json format that you generate to save should follow this structure:
    [
      {{{{
        "source" : "Gscholar",
        "title" : "title",
        "authors" : ["author1", "author2"],
        "Publish_date" : "dd-MM-YYYY",
        "url" : "url",
        "abstract" : "Abastract of the paper",
        "usefulness_score" : For each result, assign a usefullness score between 0 and 100. For each retrieved result you should judge how useful and innovative the paper is. For this evaluation, consider the methods, achievements of the paper and novelty of its proposed solution. Furthermore, in your evaluation consider how much the retrieved results are related to the given field. Score 0 indicates the least usefulness and score 100 indicates the most useful paper in the given field. You should only include Google scholar results that have usefulness_score of above {scholar_min_usefulness} in your final crafted json string. If there are no papers with usefulness_score higher than {scholar_min_usefulness}, log this and move to the next step. 
      }}}},
    ]

  After creating the VALID json, use save_to_json tool to save your crafted json object. If an error occurs while saving, revise and correct the JSON and retry.

  You are an expert researcher. Your task is to find Google Scholar papers authored by the given list of author IDs {author_ids_list} and save the results as VALID JSON.

  Tools:
    - get_scholar_papers: query Google Scholar by author ID(s).
    - save_to_json: persist the final JSON. (Requires passing source="gscholar".)
  Credentials:
    - serp_api_key: {serp_api_key}  # required by get_scholar_papers; never print or expose.

  ## Task
  1) Input preparation
     - Parse {author_ids_list} into a list of author IDs.
     - If multiple IDs are provided, you may query each ID separately and then combine results.
  
  2) Retrieval
     - Call get_scholar_papers with the author IDs (or each author ID) and max_results={scholar_max_results}.
     - If the tool returns zero usable items (across all authors), log:
       "No Google Scholar results for the provided author IDs—stopping."
       Then STOP the chain.

  3) Scoring and filtering (usefulness_score)
     - For each result, assign an integer "usefulness_score" from 0–100 based on how strongly the paper’s **title** and **abstract** address {field}.
     - Scoring rubric:
       * 90–100: Directly and substantially about {field}.
       * 60–89: Clearly relevant to {field} but not primarily focused on it.
       * 30–59: Tangential; mentions {field} or adjacent topics without substantive focus.
       * 0–29: Irrelevant to {field}.
     - Be consistent. If relevance is uncertain from the title/abstract, err on the lower score.
     - Include ONLY results with usefulness_score ≥ {scholar_min_usefulness} in the final JSON.
     - If no results meet the threshold, log:
       "No Google Scholar results ≥ {scholar_min_usefulness} for {field}—continuing to next step."
       Then proceed without error.

  4) JSON construction
     - Build a VALID JSON object with a top-level "results" array; each element is an object with the fields:
       - "source": "gscholar"
       - "title": Title of the paper.
       - "authors": List of author names.
       - "Publish_date": "DD-MM-YYYY" if available; otherwise "unknown".
       - "url": Full, accessible link to the paper/landing page.
       - "abstract": A concise 1–3 sentence summary of the paper’s abstract.
       - "usefulness_score": integer 0–100 per the rubric above.
     - If any field is missing in the tool output, infer from available information; ensure the final JSON remains VALID.
     - Deduplicate items by URL or (title + primary author).
     - Example structure:
        {{{{
          "results": [
            {{{{
              "source": "gscholar",
              "title": "Example Title",
              "authors": ["Author One", "Author Two"],
              "Publish_date": "11-07-2025",
              "url": "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=...",
              "abstract": "Brief summarized abstract of the paper.",
              "usefulness_score": 87
            }}}}
          ]
        }}}}

  5) Saving
     - After creating the VALID JSON, call save_to_json with:
       * content: the JSON object/string you built
       * source: "gscholar"
     - If saving fails due to invalid JSON, correct the JSON and retry.
